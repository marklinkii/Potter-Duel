# Potter-Duel
Simple fighting game with a wizard theme. Created in python using PyGame. 

To run, download all files. Then, using a command prompt, navigate to the file with Game.py installed. Note: if PyGame is not intsalled, type "pip install pygame". Once you ensure that pygame is installed, type "python Game.py" and then the game will start.

Note: I do not own any of the graphics or sound effects. I only own the code.
